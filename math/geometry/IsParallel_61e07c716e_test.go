1. Scenario: Both lines are parallel, having the same slope.
   - Given two lines with the same slope
   - When the IsParallel function is called with these lines as parameters
   - Then the function should return true.

2. Scenario: Both lines are not parallel, having different slopes.
   - Given two lines with different slopes
   - When the IsParallel function is called with these lines as parameters
   - Then the function should return false.

3. Scenario: One line is vertical while the other is not.
   - Given one vertical line and one non-vertical line
   - When the IsParallel function is called with these lines as parameters
   - Then the function should return false.

4. Scenario: Both lines are vertical, thus having an undefined slope.
   - Given two vertical lines
   - When the IsParallel function is called with these lines as parameters
   - Then the function should return true.

5. Scenario: Both lines are horizontal, thus having a slope of 0.
   - Given two horizontal lines
   - When the IsParallel function is called with these lines as parameters
   - Then the function should return true.

6. Scenario: Lines are parallel but in opposite directions (negative slope).
   - Given two lines with the same negative slope
   - When the IsParallel function is called with these lines as parameters
   - Then the function should return true.

7. Scenario: One or both of the lines are a point (P1 and P2 are the same).
   - Given one or two lines where P1 and P2 are the same
   - When the IsParallel function is called with these lines as parameters
   - Then the function should return false, as a point doesn't have a slope.

8. Scenario: One or both of the lines are null.
   - Given one or two null lines
   - When the IsParallel function is called with these lines as parameters
   - Then the function should return false, as a null line doesn't have a slope.

9. Scenario: Testing with real-world coordinates where lines are parallel.
   - Given two lines with real-world coordinates that are parallel
   - When the IsParallel function is called with these lines as parameters
   - Then the function should return true.

10. Scenario: Testing with real-world coordinates where lines are not parallel.
    - Given two lines with real-world coordinates that are not parallel
    - When the IsParallel function is called with these lines as parameters
    - Then the function should return false.
